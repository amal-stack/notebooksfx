# Notebooks FX
A markdown-based, note-taking app that organizes notes into sections and pages, like a notebook. Inspired by Microsoft OneNote.

*Backend:* https://github.com/amal-stack/notebooks-api


* This repository also features a very minimal dependency injection container under the [di](src/main/java/com/amalstack/notebooksfx/di) directory.
* This repository also contains an HTTP Client Wrapper and the Endpoint API which is an abstraction over raw URIs with support for named routes under [util/http](/src/main/java/com/amalstack/notebooksfx/util/http). 

*I plan to eventually move these utilities into a separate repository.*
